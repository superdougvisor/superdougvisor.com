				<h3>Mission Statement</h3>

				<p>
					For the last two and one half years, my wife and I have been victimized, intimidated and harassed by
					White lake officials, once closing our commercial building on false allegations. My appeals to the US
					Dept of Justice have resulted in the FBI being assigned to do a criminal investigation of White Lake;
					HOWEVER, the FBI has been totally overwhelmed by the global terrorist threats and consider this a
					lower priority. The FBI actually advised me to run for office to see if I could &quot;clean up&quot; this town before
					they can get to it.
				</p>
				<p>So here I am...running for Supervisor.</p>
				<p>
					However, my mission is not just to clean up White Lake government, but establish checks and balances into our
					political process, that will keep White Lake honorable for years after I am gone. To me, it is
					unfathomable, that a government we elected can become so self serving, as to virtually exclude public
					opinion from decision making. Especially in an age when it is so easy to be interconnected.	
				</p>
				<p>
					White Lake officials seem to think their primary mission is to build more stuff, make White Lake
					bigger...examples...sewers that few people want, a governmental complex...few people want...a new
					library, more business zoning, trying to attract more businesses, etc. Our town will grow naturally,
					because it is a nice place to live. You don't have to force it...or the citizens that are content with where
					we are.	
				</p>
				<p>
					In over eight presentations to the Board of Trustees, NOT ONCE did I receive an answer or a reply to ANY
					of my presentations or questions. Others questioning sewer projects, etc, receive the same treatment.
					And I might add, that after numerous legal appeals to the WL Board of Trustees (BOT), not ONE PERSON
					on that Board said one word...including my opponent for Supervisor, Rik Kowell. I guess he wants to
					expand his do nothingness to the position of Supervisor. I hope to change that...and do a lot for our
					people, but I need your vote on November 8th.	
				</p>
				<p>
					To me...THIS IS RIDICULOUS, and I am running to do my part to make White Lake government
					BY THE PEOPLE...AND FOR THE PEOPLE!
				</p>
				<p>
				By the way; nothing against Republicans, but there has not been a Democratic official at WL since the
				early seventies. (the clerk) No offense if you are a Republican, but isn't this "a little" out of balance?
				</p>
				<p>
					So at least...I am trying to bring DEMOCRACY back to White Lake.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, I can't even begin to do that...WITHOUT YOU!....SO
					IN NOVEMBER...get up, get out...AND VOTE FOR A CHANGE! It's your home too!
				</p>
				<p>
					And please refer your friends to SuperDOUGvisor.com Share the truth...
					The truth ALSO belongs to all of us, even if we have to stand for it.

				<h3>Proposals</h3>

				<p>
					I have been working with a Group of Castlewood property owners that are getting a sewer put in their
					sub that THEY have to pay for. Many have complained they were not properly informed of public
					hearings, their questions were not answered, and the vote for the project was not made according to
					State of Michigan due process law. After checking into their allegations...they are all true.
					Consequently we asked the White Lake Board for a legal re-voting of the project with full information
					disclosed. THEY HAVE OF COURSE...refused!
				</p>

				<p>
					If elected, I will set up a list of citizen emails, by area so we can inform concerned citizens on
					EVERYTHING! Including lost dogs, neighborhood watches, meetings, etc.
				</p>

				<p>
					Additionally, I propose live streaming of meetings, public hearings, etc so if you cannot attend you can
					still participate. You can even participate through Skype. Additionally we will have all meetings videoed
					and posted to our sight. Questions asked at meetings that cannot be immediately answered will be
					answered within two business days and added to our site.
				</p>

				<p>
					Also, we have had only one attorney for White Lake, that as you will read has acted more as a political
					hammer, than a law researching legal analyst. I propose having a general attorney for WL, and a
					specialist attorney for each department. No one attorney can specialize in all the law concerning a
					complex township.
				</p>

				<p>Also I will propose conducting public opinion polls for proposed projects...before we invest in them.</p>
				<p>Basically in the era of the world wide web, keeping citizens..."in the dark" only favors a self serving government.</p>
				<p>I'll "turn the lights on!"...for all of us.</p>
